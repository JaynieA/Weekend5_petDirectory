# Description
Welcome to your LAST weekend challenge!

In this challenge, I will be creating a Pet Application that allows a user to create Pets records that are stored in a database. The list will be displayed on the DOM.

The app needs to contain the following:

* A greeting at the top of the page with some direction on how to use the application
* Inputs where the user can add a new pet with a form
* Below all of that should be a list of the entered pets

Each Pet will need to have the following information:

* Name (example, Grilled Cheese)
* Animal (example, Cat),
* Age (example, 14)
* Image Url

##Jedi Knight Mode
* [x] Add a button in the Pets List to delete a pet from the database.

##Jedi Master Mode
* [ ] Use Angular Routes to have a view for each function:

* Home view (description/landing)
* Add
* All Pets

##Jedi Council Member Mode
* [ ] Look into Filtering. In the Pets view, include a button to turn on Alphabetical Sorting of the pets that can be toggled on and off.

###Technologies:
* Mongo
* Express
* Angular
* Node
* SASS
* HTML5
